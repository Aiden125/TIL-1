### ERROR log
```
HOLDEM CLUB TV BETA SERVER .....
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:qND+w98SZrjb1xXmqeDfjstM7CuEcIGL6mH/btWGf3E.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /Users/cheese/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in /Users/cheese/.ssh/known_hosts:17
ECDSA host key for ec2-52-78-61-209.ap-northeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
```


### 해결 방법
```
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ls
cheese10yun_GitHub.pub id_rsa                 known_hosts
config                 id_rsa.pub
$ rm -rf known_hosts
```
* ssh 이동후 known_hosts 제거
* known_hosts는 해당 ssh i 접근 정보들이 담겨 있는거 같다
* 이걸 지우니까 접속됨

```
